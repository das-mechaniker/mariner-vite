## Next Steps Based on Assessment
1. Create an ErrorBoundary component for consistent error handling
2. Enhance the useApi hook with better error reporting and management
3. Implement protected routes using authentication state
4. Add loading indicators to data fetching components
5. Implement form validation utilities

## Database/Model State
- Strapi backend running with proper models for:
  - Users
  - Agents
  - Documentation categories and articles
  - Research labs
  - Prompts

## Current Implementation Section

## Working
- Layout component with responsive design
- Redesigned sidebar with improved styling and user experience
- Search box in the sidebar for enterprise search
- User profile section at the bottom of sidebar
- Sidebar with active route highlighting
- Topbar with breadcrumb navigation
- React Router setup with routes for all sections
- Placeholder pages for all main sections (including new Enterprise Search page)
- Unit tests for all layout components
- Chat interface with message display and sending capability
- Responsive layout that works across different screen sizes
- GitHub repository setup and code pushed to remote

## Recently Fixed
- Replaced react-icons with lucide-react for consistent icon styling
- Updated sidebar design to match mockup from sidebar.html
- Added new Enterprise Search route and page
- Fixed sidebar disappearing on Chat page navigation
- Improved z-index handling for proper component layering
- Added responsive sidebar behavior based on screen size
- Fixed Chat component height calculation
- Created GitHub repository and pushed project code
- Fixed Strapi backend server issues and got it running successfully
- Fixed Node module version mismatch for better-sqlite3 with Node.js v20.13.1

## Broken
- API fetch in chat (console error: "Failed to fetch data")

## Current Blockers
- None

## Database/Model State
- Strapi backend is now running with SQLite database
- Created content types for User and Agent with all required fields
- Updated seed script to populate sample data for both content types
- Permissions set for public access to user and agent content types

## GitHub Repository
- Repository: https://github.com/das-mechaniker/mariner-vite
- All code has been pushed to the main branch 

## Current Project State

### Implementing Data Layer with Strapi CMS

Currently working on setting up the Strapi CMS backend based on the project specification. We have:

1. Created the following content types:
   - Agent (existed)
   - User (existed)
   - Documentation Category (new)
   - Documentation Article (new)
   - Research Lab (new)
   - Prompt (new)
   - Capability (new)

2. Created a data import script (scripts/import-mock-data.js) to populate the CMS with mock data

### What's Working
- Content type schemas have been defined
- Basic API controllers, routes, and services have been set up
- Data import script has been created

### What's Pending
- Starting Strapi server
- Running the import script to populate the database
- Connecting the frontend to the Strapi API

### Next Steps
1. Start the Strapi development server
2. Run the import script to populate the CMS with mock data
3. Verify data is imported correctly
4. Connect the frontend to the Strapi backend API 

# Cursor Context

## Current Implementation Status

### Components
