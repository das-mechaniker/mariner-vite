## Current Project State

### Implementing Data Layer with Strapi CMS

Currently working on setting up the Strapi CMS backend based on the project specification. We have:

1. Created the following content types:
   - Agent (existed)
   - User (existed)
   - Documentation Category (new)
   - Documentation Article (new)
   - Research Lab (new)
   - Prompt (new)
   - Capability (new)

2. Created a data import script (scripts/import-mock-data.js) to populate the CMS with mock data

### What's Working
- Content type schemas have been defined
- Basic API controllers, routes, and services have been set up
- Data import script has been created

### What's Pending
- Starting Strapi server
- Running the import script to populate the database
- Connecting the frontend to the Strapi API

### Next Steps
1. Start the Strapi development server
2. Run the import script to populate the CMS with mock data
3. Verify data is imported correctly
4. Connect the frontend to the Strapi backend API
